##  A Short Description of My Work <br>

I am a front-end web developer who primarily focuses on front-end web application development. I use ReactJS, JavaScript, tailwind, expressjs and mongodb to create basic frontend of web applications with a little support of the backend. 

Additionally, I am also able to design good-looking web design for web applications. I am eager to learn about the various technologies and applications within these fields.

Here are some specific examples of my work:

* Developed a website that allows users to read premium and free news articles with JWT token validation.
* Created an app that enables users to track their financial transactions through Stripe.
* Built an event management web app and a brand car shop web app with JWT cookies verification.

I am passionate about continuous learning and development, striving to become a skilled and innovative software engineer.  <br>
